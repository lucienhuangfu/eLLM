# eLLM: Achieving Lossless Million-Token LLM Inference on CPUs
🌐 Language: [English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) 

* **eLLM** is an inference framework that enables **lossless** large language models (LLMs) on **CPU-only machines**, 
* supporting **sequences up to millions of tokens**. 
* It outperforms GPU-based inference under comparable per-user cost .

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Elastic computation graph** removes the overhead of dynamic graph construction.
* **Contiguous KV cache memory layout** for efficient hardware prefetching.


## 🧠 Supported Models

* [x] LLaMA 2 / 3
* [ ] Qwen (coming soon)
* [ ] DeepSeek (coming soon)
